### Note: The following repository grew out of [Romain Brette's critical thought experiment on the free energy principle](http://romainbrette.fr/what-is-computational-neuroscience-xxix-the-free-energy-principle/). 
### Note 2: This Github repository is accompanied by [the following blog post](http://paulispace.com/statistics/2018/04/07/causal_path_entropy.html). 

# Motivation:

1. Until recently, the Free Energy Principle has been a constant source of mockery from neuroscientists who misunderstood it and so I hope that by growing a collection 
of free-energy motivated reinforcement learning examples on Github we may finally have a constructive discussion between scientists
2. The details of the first experiment are contained in the [following notebook](https://github.com/pauli-space/Free_Energy_experiments/blob/master/simulation.ipynb).
